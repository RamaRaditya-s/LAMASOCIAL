## Suggestions for Further Improvement

- **API Integration:** Replace dummy data with real API calls using SWR, React Query, or Next.js server actions when backend is ready.
- **State Management:** For more complex state, consider using Context API, Redux, or Zustand to manage global state (e.g., user, stories, modals).
- **Accessibility:** Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management for modals and interactive elements.
- **Error Handling:** Add user-friendly error and loading states for data fetching and image loading.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize image sizes, use lazy loading, and consider memoization for heavy components.
- **Code Reusability:** Extract repeated UI patterns (e.g., story cards) into smaller reusable components.
- **Type Safety:** Strengthen TypeScript usage by defining and enforcing types/interfaces for all props and data structures.
- **Responsive Enhancements:** Test and refine UI for a wider range of devices and screen sizes, including touch gestures for carousels.
- **Theming:** Consider supporting dark mode and user-customizable themes.

## Weaknesses of Current Implementation

- **No Real Data:** Uses hardcoded dummy data; not connected to backend or API, so not production-ready.
- **Limited Accessibility:** Modal and interactive elements lack ARIA attributes and keyboard support.
- **Minimal Error Handling:** No handling for image load failures or missing data.
- **Scalability:** State is local and not suitable for larger, more interactive applications.
- **Code Duplication:** Some UI logic (e.g., story card rendering) is repeated and could be abstracted.
- **Testing Coverage:** No automated tests present for components or UI flows.
- **TypeScript Gaps:** Some `any` types and implicit types reduce type safety.
- **Performance:** All images are loaded at once; no lazy loading or pagination for stories.
- **UI Consistency:** Placeholder components are basic and may not match the final design system.

*Note: These weaknesses are expected at this stage, as the current focus is on frontend prototyping. Addressing them will be important as the project matures and API integration begins.*
## Code Review & KPI Analysis

### 1. Next.js/React Usage
- **File Type:** React Server Component (with `"use client"` for client-side interactivity).
- **Dynamic Imports:** Uses `next/dynamic` for code-splitting and client-only rendering of `LeftMenu` and `RightMenu`.
- **Image Optimization:** Uses Next.js `Image` component for optimized image loading.
- **State Management:** Uses React's `useState` for modal/story viewing.

### 2. Business Logic
- **Dummy Data:** Hardcoded user and stories data for prototyping.
- **Story Carousel & Viewer:** Implements a horizontally scrollable carousel and a grid viewer for stories, with modal pop-up for viewing a story in detail.
- **User Profile Section:** Displays user cover and avatar with fallback images.

### 3. Design Patterns
- **Componentization:** UI is split into small, reusable components (`StoryCarousel`, `StoryViewer`, placeholders, etc.).
- **Dynamic Loading:** Uses dynamic imports for performance and SSR compatibility.
- **Separation of Concerns:** UI, data, and logic are separated into components and dummy data.

### 4. SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component (e.g., `StoryCarousel`, `StoryViewer`) has a clear, single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed:** Components are open for extension (e.g., can add more props/data) but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution:** Components can be replaced with others of similar interface (e.g., placeholders).
- **Interface Segregation:** Props are minimal and specific (e.g., `user` prop for `RightMenuPlaceholder`).
- **Dependency Inversion:** Uses dynamic imports and props to decouple dependencies.

### 5. Responsive UI
- **Tailwind CSS:** Uses utility classes for responsive design (`hidden`, `block`, `w-[20%]`, `lg:w-[70%]`, etc.).
- **Flex/Grid Layouts:** Uses flexbox and grid for adaptive layouts.
- **Mobile Support:** Story carousel is horizontally scrollable; main layout adapts for different breakpoints.

### 6. General Observations
- **Modern React Patterns:** Uses hooks, dynamic imports, and functional components.
- **No API Integration:** Currently uses dummy data; real implementation would fetch from a backend.
- **Accessibility:** Modal uses overlay and close button, but could improve ARIA attributes.
- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, and modular.
